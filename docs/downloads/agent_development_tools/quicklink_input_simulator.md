# QuickLink Input Simulator

The purpose of this tool is to give complete control of the input-link to the Soar
programmer. QuickLink can be thought of as a way to "fake" an external application,
such as a game or simulation, in order to test specific circumstances that are rare
and/or hard to reproduce. QuickLink currently can only be operated through the use
of a command line interface.
