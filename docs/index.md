# Soar Homepage

Soar is a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit
intelligent behavior. For more in-depth information, see our [about](home/About.md)
page, or J.E. Laird's 2012 book,
[*The Soar Cognitive Architecture*](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/sitemaker/misc/7688_jkt_au.pdf),
available from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Soar-Cognitive-Architecture-John-Laird/dp/0262122960/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332172759&sr=8-1-spell)
and [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/soar-cognitive-architecture).

To get started, [download Soar](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/releases/download/releases%2F{{soar_version}}/Soar-Release-{{soar_version}}.zip)
and follow the [quick start guide](home/QuickStart.md).

## News and Announcements

*   [**Soar 9.6.3 available for download**](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/releases/download/releases%2F{{soar_version}}/SoarSuite_{{soar_version}}-Multiplatform.zip):
This release of Soar contains ergonomic improvements to the debugger and Soar CLI,
lots of new VisualSoar features, and plenty of bug fixes and stability
improvements. Note: if you are a Mac user with an Intel processor and you
downloaded the release prior to August 19, 2024, then you will need to
re-download. There was an issue with the setup script for Mac/Intel users which
would prevent running Soar.
*   **44th Soar Workshop 2024** This year’s Soar workshop will be held on May 29,
2024, at the University of Michigan’s Beyster Building on North Campus in Ann
Arbor, MI. It will be a hybrid workshop, and remote presentations will be possible.
As in the past, it will be free.

    Please consider participating! If you are interested in the workshop, please
complete the registration form.

    Registration closes on 10 May. We look forward to seeing you at the 2024 Soar
    Workshop!

*   [**VISCA-2021**](https://visca.engin.umich.edu/) The University of Michigan
Soar group hosted VISCA-2021, the Virtual International Symposium on Cognitive
Architecture, on June 7-11, 2021. VISCA included leaders from across the breadth
of cognitive architecture, including research on modeling human behavior,
neural-cognitive architectures, functional capabilities of cognitive architectures,
components of cognitive architectures, and their applications. Follow the link to

Congratulations to Professor John Laird and Professor Paul Rosenbloom for being
awarded the 2018 Herbert A. Simon Prize for Advances in Cognitive Systems! This
lifetime achievement award recognizes their 30 years of research on cognitive
architectures, especially their Soar project, their applications to knowledge-based
systems and models of human cognition, and their contributions to theories of
representation, reasoning, problem solving, and learning.

LuminAI is a dome-based art installation at the National Museum of American History
in which participants can engage in collaborative movement improvisation with
each other and with virtual Soar-based dance partners, developed at the ADAM Lab.
